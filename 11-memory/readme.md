# Types of Memory

```bash
Memory is a crucial cognitive function that allows us to store, retain, and recall information. It can be categorized into several types based on duration and nature of the information stored:
   - Short-term Memory -> The capacity for holding a small amount of information in an active, readily available state for a short period.
   - Long-term Memory -> The continuous storage of information, which can last from minutes to a lifetime.
        - Factual Memory -> The knowledge of facts and information.
        - Episodic Memory -> The recollection of personal experiences and specific events.
        - Semantic Memory -> The memory of meanings, understandings, and other concept-based knowledge unrelated to specific experiences.
```

# What to extract out of a memory

```bash
When extracting information from memory, it is essential to focus on:
   - Key Concepts -> The main ideas or principles that are fundamental to understanding the subject.
   - Important Details -> Specific facts or pieces of information that support the key concepts.
   - Contextual Information -> Background or situational details that provide a framework for understanding the key concepts and details.
